Borrowing the words of Iliza Shlesinger, I'm an elder millennial. Also a web developer since around 1998. I've been here for most of the crazy shit we came up with and it's no different nowadays. We still periodically reinvent wheels and strut around like peacocks.

I'm not a webdev superstar like a lot of the folk who are now stacking JAM on Netlify, but I can pull my weight just fine.

It's been ages. Since basically, never? Yes, I never really created a site I would run experiments on and dump my wisdom and folly on. Time to change that and immortalize my brainfarts.
